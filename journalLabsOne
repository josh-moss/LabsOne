SDV503 - LabsOne - journal

 today in sdv503 we learnt how to code simple calculations using JavaScript to obtain a conclusion. 
 Some of the obstacles I had to overcome was accidentally hard coding the numbers and outcomes using a console logged message 
 to display the full calculation, displaying the outcome on its own with no message saying the “sum =” and leaving spaces in my code
 resulting in an error. 

 With help from Ali and classmates I was able to understand what I had done wrong and was able to correct my mistakes. 
A fellow classmate Matt was having a few problems because he had joined the class late, so I helped him with his code. 
This enabled me to reinforce my understanding with variables as I wrote multiple copies of the code to help him understand
what we had been doing. 

 
 Matt also show me some shortcuts that I could have used to make my coding easer, for example, instead of displaying
 the variable as “numOne” I could have shown it as “n1” to save time typing. 

 
I'm feeling a lot more confident with my ability to use git than I was last week but there is still room for improvement.
